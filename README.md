# Appium Benchmarks

This repository contains a suite of exercises designed to evaluate the performance of an Appium server or service. It can run a set of predetermined tests and extract information such as average command time, latency, etc... With the appropriate caution (ensuring parity of environments along relevant dimensions), it can be used to generate comparisons of Appium servers (hosted locally, on public cloud services, or at specialized Appium service providers).

The goal of this project is to define a standard set of tests which can be applied in different environments to give an estimation of the effect of these environments on the speed and reliability of an Appium test suite.

The goal of this project is NOT to host a database of comparisons for public perusal. There are too many factors to be controlled for. But you can use it yourself to test the relative performance of Appium servers from wherever you're sitting.
